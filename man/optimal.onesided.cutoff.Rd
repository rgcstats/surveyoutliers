\usage{
optimal.onesided.cutoff(formula, surveydata, historical.reweight = 1,
  stop = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{The regression formula (e.g. income ~ employment + old.turnover if income is survey variable and employment and old.turnover are auxiliary variables).}

\item{surveydata}{A data frame of the survey data including the variables in formula, piwt (inverse probability of selection) and gregwt (generalized regression estimator weight).}

\item{historical.reweight}{A set of reweighting factors for use when a historical dataset is being used.
It reweights from the historical sample to the sample of interest.
The default value of 1 should be used if the sample being used for optimising Q is the
same sample (or at least the same design) as the sample to which the winsorizing cutoffs are to be applied.}

\item{stop}{Set to T to open a browser window (for debugging purposes)}
}
\value{
A list consisting of Q.opt (the optimal Q), rlm.coef (the robust regression coefficients),
cutoffs (the winsorizing cutoffs for each unit in sample), y (the values of the variable of interest),
win1.values (the type 1 winsorized values of interest, i.e. the minimums of the cutoff and y)
win2.values (the type 2 winsorized values of interest, so that sum(surveydata$gregwt*win2.values) is the winsorized estimator)
}
\description{
This function calculates optimal one-sided cutoffs for winsorization
where regression residuals are truncated at Q / (weight-1)
and Q satisfies the optimality result in Kokic and Bell (1994) and Clark (1995).
